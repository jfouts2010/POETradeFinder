# POETradeFinder

An old trade finder for the game Path of Exile. It used POE's Trade API to find good deals on items. It would look at "set" items, like uniques, and compare their buyout price to the average price pulled from poeninja.com as well as poe.trade. Essentially obsolete due to the new delay introduced by the developers.
